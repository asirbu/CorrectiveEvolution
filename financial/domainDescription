Business Processing Intelligence Challenge (BPIC)

"An application is submitted through a webpage. Then, some automatic checks are performed, 
after which the application is complemented with additional information. This information 
is obtained through contacting the customer by phone. If an applicant is eligible, an 
offer is sent to the client by mail. After this offer is received back, it is assessed. 
When it is incomplete, missing information is added by again contacting the customer. 
Then a final assessment is done, after which the application is approved and activated."
